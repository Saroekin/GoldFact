# GoldFact
#Welcome!

#How /u/GoldFact is used:

###Requesting a gold fact:

To call him, use his name in a comment. Like so:

> A /u/GoldFact, if you will!

>A /u/goldfact, if you will!

Notice that capitalization doesn't affect /u/GoldFact's response. 

=
*(****Note****: The message/comment could include anything text related. As long as /u/GoldFact is mentioned, he will reply with a gold fact.)*

=
Full response example:

> User: 

>Where's my /u/goldfact?

=
>/u/GoldFact:

>It looks as though I've been summoned! Here's the gold fact as you've requested:

>>Before gold coins were used as money, various types of livestock, particularly cattle, and plant products were used as currency. Additionally, large government construction projects were completed by slave labor due to the limited range of money uses.

###/u/GoldFact commenting:

If you're comment was recently gilded, then you have a 1/3 chance for /u/GoldFact to respond with . . . well, a gold fact!

His message will have the same format as follows:

>Hello there ol' chap! It seems to me that you've been gilded, therefore congratulations! Here's a gold fact to celebrate:

>>When honking geese alerted the Romans that the Gauls were about to attack the temple where the Romans stored their treasure, the grateful Roman citizens built a shrine to Moneta, the goddess of warning. The link between rescued treasure and Moneta led many centuries later to the English words “money” and “mint.”

###Ignoring /u/GoldFact:

If would like /u/GoldFact to not respond to at all (even if you mention his name), then you may type in:
>ignore-/u/GoldFact 

This will stop /u/GoldFact from replying/commenting towards your gilded comment or being summoned via username mention.

=

If you accidentally ignored or changed your mind on ignoring /u/GoldFact, then you may reestablish contact with him by using this command:
>obey-/u/GoldFact
